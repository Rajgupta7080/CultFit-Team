# STORY
So I am learning Full Stack Web Development course in Masai School, In Masai school, we have to show our skills and learning in a particular unit by doing a project so management assign a task to clone a *CULT-FIT* website in 7 days and we did that very well. In my team, there are 3 members excluding me, After some discussions and meetings about how we started and what are the tech stacks we have to use we are starting work on that and completed our project in a week very well.

## LEARNING OUTCOME
In this project, we faced a lot of challenges like collaborating with all team members at the same time. 
But yes!, We learned a lot about teamwork and also how to communicate well in a team.
We also learned how to apply soft skills in a team to cooperate in work. We also applied some concepts that we didn't know before. All this happened because of our team's spirit to learn and apply new things. 
And at last, we all achieved what we wanted in our website
